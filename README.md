Enables the pilgrims to perform Hajj without loss (life, emotions or health) with minimal human computer interaction.

## What it does
- Let Hajj admin monitors (automated in future) crowd behavior and gives instruction on the fly to the pilgrims to prevent stampede.
- Notifies Hajj admin about any suspicious or emergency situations which require attention or assistance.
- Enables the pilgrims to track their loved ones in real time if they are missing.
